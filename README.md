# MxIF_Normalization

A repository to hold existing code from the multiplexed imaging normalization projects.

## Description (03-11-2021)
- Code used to register can be found in `reg_210224.Rmd`
- Code for clustering is either in:
	- `adapting_simons_atlas_code.R` (Mclust)
	- `further_clustering_210308.Rmd` (Otsu thresholding, K-means)
- Report on all clustering results can be found in: `atlas_clustering_results_report.Rmd`
- Various normalization/registration methods (both in progress and already finished) can be found in `atlas_combat.Rmd`
- The `archive` directory holds old code, markdown, and HTML files
- The `simon_and_julia` directory holds examples (adapted and raw) from S. Vandekar and J. Wrobel
- The `combat_functions` directory holds multiple scripts to perform variations of the multiplexed combat adjustment
